I don't include cert files in this public repo.

You can gen these using these three commands:
openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -key privatekey.pem -out publickey.cer -days 1825
openssl pkcs12 -export -out public_privatekey.pfx -inkey privatekey.pem -in publickey.cer

Once the files are generated add the contents of privatekey.pem to the
ESP32 firmware via the KEY variable and the contents of the publickey.cer to the CERT variable.
